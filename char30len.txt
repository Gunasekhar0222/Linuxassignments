1. To print the lines having greater than 30 characters in File1.txt:

grep -E '.{31,}' File1.txt


This command uses the grep tool with the -E option to enable extended regular expressions, and the pattern 
.{31,} to match any line that has 31 or more characters


2.To remove the lines having greater than 30 characters and store them in File2.txt


grep -vE '.{31,}' File1.txt > File2.txt


This command uses the grep tool with the -v option to invert the matching, 
so that it selects all the lines that do not match the pattern
 .{31,}, i.e., the lines that have less than or equal to 30 characters.
 The output is redirected to the file File2.txt using the > operator.

3.To remove the dot (.) or end period if it is at the end of each line and store the result in File3.txt:

sed 's/\(\.\)\{0,1\}$//' File2.txt > File3.txt

This command uses the sed tool with the s (substitute) command to replace any dot (.) or end period at the end of each line (i.e., zero or one occurrence) with nothing (i.e., an empty string). 
The output is redirected to the file File3.txt using the > operator.




grep -vE '.{31,}' File1.txt > File2.txt sed 's/\(\.\)\{0,1\}$//' File2.txt > File3.txt
